I built this project in order to practice polishing and releasing a finished product. While it is a small and relatively simple game, I accomplished exactly what I set out to do. This project was great practice as it introduced me to a lot of important pieces of game development that I had not used previously, such as sound effects and save files.

## Notable Features
- Custom 3D models and textures
- Imported sound effects to give the player more satisfying feedback
- Save files so that you can view your personal best score
- Built for WebGL so that it is playable in a browser
